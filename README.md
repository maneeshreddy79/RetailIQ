# RetailIQ

### Adaptive Data Analytics & Business Insight System

RetailIQ is an interactive data analytics application that transforms an unfamiliar CSV or Excel dataset into a structured analytical workspace.

Instead of manually inspecting, cleaning, profiling, visualizing, and deciding what to analyze, RetailIQ automates the initial stages of the data analyst workflow and provides data-driven recommendations for the next analytical steps.

> **Upload → Profile → Clean → Analyze → Visualize → Recommend**

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

When a data analyst receives a new dataset, the first challenge is understanding the data before performing deeper analysis.

A typical initial workflow involves:

- Understanding the dataset structure
- Identifying data types and column roles
- Detecting missing values and duplicates
- Cleaning inconsistent data
- Identifying useful dimensions and measures
- Creating relevant KPIs
- Exploring trends and category-level patterns
- Studying relationships between variables
- Deciding which analyses or dashboards would be useful

Performing these steps manually for every new dataset can be repetitive and time-consuming.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

RetailIQ provides an adaptive analytics workspace that automatically examines an uploaded dataset and determines how it can be analyzed.

The application:

1. Accepts a CSV or Excel dataset
2. Profiles the dataset automatically
3. Performs conservative data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Detects numeric, categorical, and date-like fields
5. Generates relevant KPIs
6. Creates interactive visualizations
7. Provides data-quality insights
8. Recommends suitable analytical next steps
9. Allows users to filter and export the processed data

The system is designed to work with **unfamiliar datasets rather than a single fixed schema**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📂 Multi-Format Dataset Upload

Supports common tabular formats:

- CSV
- XLSX
- XLS

Users can upload their own dataset and begin analysis without manually configuring the application for a specific schema.

---

### 🔍 Automatic Dataset Profiling

RetailIQ automatically examines the uploaded dataset and identifies:

- Number of rows
- Number of columns
- Numeric columns
- Categorical columns
- Date-like columns
- Missing values
- Unique values
- Potential column roles
- Dataset-level quality information

---

### 🧹 Automated Data Cleaning

The preprocessing pipeline performs conservative cleaning operations such as:

- Standardizing column names
- Removing completely empty columns
- Removing duplicate rows
- Trimming unnecessary whitespace
- Detecting date-like columns
- Converting suitable fields to datetime format

Cleaning actions are tracked so users can understand the transformations performed on the dataset.

---

### 📊 Adaptive KPI Generation

RetailIQ dynamically identifies suitable numeric measures and generates relevant KPIs.

Examples include:

- Row count
- Total values
- Average values
- Number of dimensions
- Data-quality percentage

The KPI layer adapts to the structure of the uploaded dataset instead of relying entirely on hard-coded business metrics.

---

### 📈 Interactive Analytics Dashboard

The application provides interactive analytical views including:

- KPI cards
- Dataset filters
- Trend analysis
- Category breakdowns
- Contribution/share analysis
- Numeric relationships
- Data distributions

Visualizations adapt according to the available columns in the uploaded dataset.

---

### 🎯 Business Recommendations

RetailIQ analyzes the characteristics of the dataset and recommends appropriate next analytical steps.

Examples include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Dashboard development
- Time-series analysis
- Data segmentation
- Data-quality improvements

The recommendations explain **why** a particular analytical approach may be useful.

---

### 🛡️ Data Quality Analysis

RetailIQ provides visibility into potential data-quality problems including:

- Missing values
- Duplicate records
- Empty columns
- Constant columns
- Column-level issues
- Cleaning actions

This helps users understand the reliability of the dataset before making analytical conclusions.

---

### 📥 Filtered Data Export

Users can apply filters to the dataset and export the resulting data as a CSV file for further analysis.

## 🧠 Recommendation Engine

RetailIQ currently uses a **rule-based recommendation approach**.

The recommendation system examines the structure and characteristics of the uploaded dataset and determines which analytical actions are appropriate.

For example:

```text
Dataset contains date + numeric measure
                ↓
        Time-series analysis
        may be recommended
```

or:

```text
Dataset contains categorical
and numeric variables
                ↓
       Segmentation /
       breakdown analysis
       may be recommended
```

This approach allows the application to provide recommendations without requiring a machine-learning model.

---

## 🤖 Does RetailIQ Use Machine Learning?

### Current Version: No

The current V0.5 implementation does **not use machine-learning models for prediction**.

Instead, it focuses on:

- Automated data profiling
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory analytics
- Visualization
- Rule-based recommendations

Machine-learning based capabilities are part of the future roadmap rather than the current implementation.
